/* The file structure with client and server is the only solution I am able to
find in order to make the app working. React-creat-app requires
babel-jest@26.6.0 while the jest used for backend unit test should be
babel-jest@27.3.1. Otherwise, the unit test will require a modification in the
mongodb package (TextEncoder not defined error). This file structure, however,
should be working just as the one instructed in the README.md. */
